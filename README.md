## 📁 Project Structure

```
SpotifyClone/
├── index.html       # Main HTML file with semantic markup
├── style.css        # Styles (dark theme, responsive)
├── app.js           # Interactive JavaScript features
├── assets/img       # Image and icon assets
└── README.md        # This file
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection for Google Fonts and Font Awesome (CDN)

### Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server:

```bash
# using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## 🎮 How to Use

- Play/Pause: click the play button or press Space
- Seek: drag or click the progress bar
- Navigation: use the sidebar to switch views (UI only)
- Click cards to simulate playing a track

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- CSS3 (flexbox, media queries, transitions)
- JavaScript (vanilla) for DOM interactions
- Google Fonts (Montserrat)
- Font Awesome for icons

## ♿ Accessibility

- Semantic elements (`nav`, `main`, `aside`, `article`, `footer`)
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation and focus indicators
- Descriptive `alt` text for images

## ✅ Notes

- Ensure an `assets/` folder is present at the project root so image references like `./assets/logo.png` resolve.
- This project is a front-end UI demo and does not include a streaming backend.
